## Requirements
 * Select a sorting algorithm to perform a benchmark on.
 * Both the iterative and recursive implementation of the algorithm must be used in the benchmark.
 * Identify a critical operation to record that reflects performance of the algorithm.
 * Record run time of each trial.
 * Verify that data is successfully sorted, otherwise throw an exception.
 * Randomly generate data. 50 data sets for each trial.
 * Ten different sized trials that clearly show the algorithm's performance with a growing data set.
 * Calculate average and coefficient of variance for critical operation and run time for the 50 runs of each trial.
 * Perform JVM warmup to ensure the benchmark is accurate.
 * Output all required data in tablular form.  (Forgot to do this bullet point, lost points on my format)
